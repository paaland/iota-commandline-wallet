    // The basic concept of this config file is that the wallet itself can be startet under different names
    // in Linux you can do this by creating a softlink, in windows you just copy the original my-wallet.js
    // to the name you want to use. For example: copy my-wallet.js alices-wallet.js
    // when the wallet is started it looks for its own name and reads the corresponding config section.
    // So you can handle multiple wallets easily.
    // When adding a new section below dont forget to add a comma at the end of the previous section.

    // SECURITY: Do not store the wallet-config on your pc, since the Seeds (MASTER passwords to access all your iota)
    // are stored in the config. You can safely put the whole wallet on an USB stick! Dont forget to copy the sub-directory
    // named node_modules with all its contents, since these are the external modules required by the wallet.
    // You also might simply execute the whole installation on an USB stick.
